        <div align="justify">
        <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Life began When I was born on <strong>November 19, 2001</strong>.<sup>1</sup> I had a huge head and for I always wear a beanie hat. 
            I was always inside the house because I never had a friend, toys became my friends.<sup>2</sup> Having so much toys and no one to play with, 
            that made me to avoid interacting to people.<sup>3</sup> At some point of my childhood I met my only friend his name is <b><i>Roby</i></b>, he is the only person I played with but not consistently until he moved.<sup>4</sup>
            It was back again from staying at home, as preschool started I met another friend and up until now I cannot remember his name.<sup>5</sup> Then when I was gonna be Grade 1,
            my only friend on that school also left and studied on a different school.<sup>6</sup> As I was growing up with a very few friends, my <em>allergies</em> and <em>asthma</em> started to show up.<sup>7</sup>
            From that point I was a very sensitive person not only my personality but also my skin, it was hard for me to play or interact because of my wounds all over my body and my <em>asthma</em>.<sup>8</sup>
            I was consistenly been taken care of and visited every dermatologist there is, it was not a fun part of my childhood but I still get to enjoy even on my own company.<sup>9</sup>
            Then on my primary education days, I was <strong>bullied</strong> several times but then I met a friend who is also my neighbor up until now his name is <b><i>Karl</i></b>.<sup>10</sup> We became bestfriends and never leave each others side,
            it was fun also several birthday are always with him.<sup>11</sup> My favorite to do was just constantly playing, I really like enjoyment that all I wanted everyday was that to have fun playing with other people.<sup>12</sup>
            Experiencing 90s street games, my life was complete with that everyday doing it.<sup>13</sup> From being protected at home and comfort, I was able to keep up to other children to play street games and continue playing without any <var>asthma</var> occuring.<sup>14</sup>
            We tried every games as possible to be done on street, from <b>baseball</b>, <b>football</b>, <b>soccer</b>, <b>basketball</b>, <b>volleyball</b> and more.</kbd><sup>15</sup> That memories completed my childhood, it made me whole and also my experience on tiredness.<sup>16</sup>
            My parents taught me everything and it was all about how to have fun, it was to always make me happy with all the toys and games they have.<sup>17</sup> Having a brother to help you and join with you 
            it was the best, I looked up to him up until I was better on my own.<sup>18</sup> My parents gave everything I wanted and a little bit of spoiled child, I have everything to play and company myself 
            when I'm alone.<sup>19</sup> Because of my <var>allergies</var> I was like a glass that was fragile on anything, so the comfort my parents gave to me was wholesome.<sup>20</sup> But at some point I have to be strong enough,
            to <strong>fight my asthma and allergies</strong> so this will not stop me from what I want to do.<sup>21</sup> But grateful enough to live like a child in my childhood days.<sup>22</sup></div></blockquote></p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">TEENAGE YEARS</mark></h2>
        <div align="justify">
        <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becoming a teen was the <ins>starting point,</ins> it was where I saw my <strong>true friends</strong>.<sup>1</sup> This is the time where I know which is which I want, entering Junior HighSchool was both scary and fun.<sup>2</sup>
           Starting in grade 7 I was <strong>bullied</strong> and an average student not so special<sup>3</sup> It was also the first time where I also experienced a <var>failed</var> subject on 3rd QTR, It was a math subject.<sup>4</sup> I was devasted that 
           day when I saw my report card having an <b>F</b>, from that day my mindset changed that I will never get a <dfn>failed grades again in my report card.</dfn><sup>5</sup> I was not smart on my highschool days so it was all a struggle to 
           pass every year.<sup>6</sup> Then in grade 8 I was <strong>bullied</strong> here this was the year I really hated for the nonstop bullying I experienced.<sup>7</sup> Moving on to grade 9 this was the best year when I was in highschool, this was the 
           year I met my true friends that even my bestfriend was my classmate.<sup>8</sup> They say that the year where your most happy and having fun is the year the time is fast.<sup>9</sup> But every moment on that year was so great, even academically
           it was a good year for me.<sup>10</sup> Then on grade 10 it was just a normal year but with the true friend I got we all became very close that for the whole year we just hang out and talk more to each other.<sup>11</sup>
           But that 4 years I made a lot of mistakes, it was not all happy moments there are also a not so good moments.<sup>12</sup> There is one time I almost got killed by a tricyle, I really don't know what was happening in my mind.<sup>13</sup>
           But when I left the school and I was gonna cross the road, I did'nt even bother to look to my left and <ss>right.</ss><sup>14</sup> Luckily the tricyle avoided me even he was driving fast, I was just really thankful that day I wasn't hit by the tricycle.
           <sup>15</sup>
           There is also where I played too much on the <code>computer shop that my parents came to school finding me,</code> that even the driver of my school bus and the guard of my school is finding me.<sup>16</sup>
           I was shock when I saw my mom crying near the school looking for me, and there <kbd>I was leaving from the computer shop</kbd>.<sup>17</sup> I did a lot of mistakes that made my parents strict on all the things I do.<sup>18</sup>
           I had my freedom when I stepped on Senior HighSchool, this year made me realize it was near and the my <u>responsibilities</u> are expanding every year.<sup>19</sup> Senior HighSchool was a busy years but me and my friends find time 
           and we play basketball every single day after school hours.<sup>20</sup> That routine made me always want to go to school, because it was a destress for us after a long hours of learning.<sup>21</sup>
           Senior Highschool was just a short year for me, but gained a lot of knowledge.<sup>22</sup> This is also the years I spent most of my time on gadget playing and playing, that I became addicted to it.<sup>23</sup>
           It was addicting that even studying I didn't bother to do it and <s>cramming</s> was becoming normal to me.<sup>24</sup></div></blockquote></p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center">COLLEGE YEARS</mark></h2>
        <div align="justify">
        <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This <small>2</small> years of <u>College was challenging,</u> learning in online class was the reason it was challening.<sup>1</sup> First when your a transferee from a different school, 
            it is hard to make friend online.<sup>2</sup> 
           On the first year it was bearable then I met <b><i>Manubay</i></b>, when I ask for something he immediately helped me and he was friendly so we became friends up until now.<sup>3</sup> Also I met <b><i>Ting</i></b> we had same interest on playing
           mobile games and computer games, it was easy to interact when your both have the same interest.<sup>4</sup> On the first year of studying <samp>Information Technology</samp>, I really hated it the fact that I didn't really want 
           to enroll in this course.<sup>5</sup> But my parents forced me to and to leave on my <var>comfort zone,</var> so on the first year I was not that serious on this course because I was preparing to shift on the first 2 weeks of classes.<sup>6</sup>
           But I was stopped to shift and just continue this course, so the whole year of it I still didn't accept that I will be studying Information Technology for the reason of my parents that its in demand.<sup>7</sup>
           That is why when I stepped on second year I struggle so much because <em>I really didn't learn that much on the first year.</em><sup>8</sup> I was just focused on leaving this course and not to take it seriously, 
           it was a big mistake I did that made me to strive on my second year first sem.<sup>9</sup> This year <sup>2022</sup> is the year I accepted that I will finish and gradute with a degree of <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</strong>.<sup>10</sup>
           It was a change I did to myself to accept and to not blame anyone for the decisions and the events that happened, now I am old enough I should be responsible on my actions.<sup>11</sup>
           College for me when I entered was I thought is focusing that much, but as time goes on I realized the only solution is <b>sacrifice what you want right now from what you really want.</b><sup>12</sup>
           That this time it's for a change not just to finish it but graduating with it having a well personality and well minded person.<sup>13</sup> Honestly I am still struggling, I still have doubts, fear and anxiety about it.<sup>14</sup> 
           For this I did is a step by step process, I do not need to know all and perfected it all.<sup>15</sup> I just have to learn how it worked, and with a bit of practice even a slow progress is a big step for a future projects.<sup>16</sup>
           Starting my 2022 building a better habits so that I can catch up on hard lessons or challenging projects.<sup>17</sup> For the upcoming <em>thesis</em>, this what makes me so nervous that I really am preparing myself
           that if I would be joining a random group without knowing them.<sup>18</sup> I will have a contribution and may we pass the thesis in the future.<sup>19</sup> So that when I step on 3rd year, I am ready and prepared so that 
           I will not have any doubts about myself and be confident enough to help and contribute to the group.<sup>20</sup> Whoever my groupmates will be I'm okay with it, and I hope we become friends
           and working to it as a group and not individually.<sup>21</sup></div></blockquote></p>
